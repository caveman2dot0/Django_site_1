# Django_site_1
My first Django project, with many different apps on it. Some include:

cats: which is a basic CRUD to allow you to create, read, update, and delete breeds of cats, as well as specific cats.
giveitem:: which is my first steps of working out a password generator. In this, I use python to create a value and return it in HTML using django views, models, and templates.

passwordgen: the first draft of the real password generator. It now has 3 working levels (easy, medium, hard)  These are created by randomly searching files containing words. One file, shortword2, contains words 4-8 letters long. The other, longword2, contains words 9-12 letters long. It then takes these random words and puts them into a string and puts random numbers and special characters at the end.

There are other apps which I created on my own or in following along in various tutorials, such as DJ4E (Django for Everyone)
